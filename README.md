reCOGnise
=========

`reCOGnise` is a tool/pipeline for species assignment (specI cluster) of microbial genomes using COG marker genes. The original workflow underlying `reCOGnise` was used e.g. for species assignment of the [proGenomes database](https://progenomes.embl.de). Work on this nextflow-wrapper was supported by [NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/).
